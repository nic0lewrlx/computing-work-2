**Cikgu Nora**âœŒ

Cikgu Nora IS so funny and friendly.
I like her lessons
Because when she calls me to answer a question I always know how to
She cracks many jokes, and pronounces some names wrongly
Whenever i hear her say shen en or jayleen its so funny
She is very kind and nice
She is very good
but I couldnt go refil my water bottle
because I had to ask her in Malay
But all i muttered out was WATAH???
lucky my best friend help me translate
but I still pronounce wronly 
It was so funny
because Cikgu Nora corrected me  laughed
she is very funny
